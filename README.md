# Forever Alone Process (FAP)  
Software Development Methodology and Roadmap for Sole Programmers and Freelancers

##Motivation
I had been struggling to find any minimal software development methodology that can work for relatively small, one-two person projects.  
When I researched the topic it was not uncommon to find testimonies like ["I held a progress meeting with myself over a one-man burn down chart every morning"](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/59713/best-development-methodology-for-one-person).  

Personally [Programming motherfucker](http://programming-motherfucker.com/) style cowboy programming often lead me to unfinished projects and frustration, I am just not that good yet. Sadly I was never able to fully get the hang of the today popular [agile methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), no matter how much I tried. So I went back in time to university, where the infamous, traditional [Rational Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process) had been forced down our throats, way before we ever acquired any software development experience. Despite the bad timing on learning it, I liked it. This gave me the first insight to the big picture of what the hell is going on in a corporate ~~workpace~~ playground. Several years ago this thread of thoughts led me to [Agile Unified Process](http://www.ambysoft.com/unifiedprocess/agileUP.html) (AUP) and started to use it in my solo projects.  

> If nobody supervises you, you have to supervise yourself. (Bucket list, Item 179, status: completed - first time  I quote myself.)  
  
Time flew, things changed, books were read, experience were gained and I found myself using a reduced, lean, flexible and completely raped version of AUP.  
I also noticed there are many repetitive administrative work I was doing over and over again every time I applied this to a new project. Now, the time finally came to armor myself with a guide and a bunch of templates on this development process.  

## Disclaimer:
I am not an expert on the topic, I just outline a process that works better for me, than anything else I tried before.  

## Why this name?  
Because if you like this process you can recommend it on the internet, somehow like this: "Have you tried to [FAP](https://github.com/nopara73/ForeverAloneProcess)?". Or if it accidentally gets well-known you can say: "Do you even [FAP](https://github.com/nopara73/ForeverAloneProcess) bro?"

## Before you start

### Ask yourself 
**Should I FAP together my next project?**  
Fortunately there is a mechanic way to decide it, by asking two questions.  
1. Does my project involve more than three developers?  
If your answer to this question is yes, then your answer to the main question is no.  
2. What stage am I in the [Dreyfus model](https://github.com/nopara73/ForeverAloneProcess/wiki/The-Five-Dreyfus-Model-Stages)?  
If your answer to this question is not Advanced Beginner or Competent, then your answer to the main question is no.
