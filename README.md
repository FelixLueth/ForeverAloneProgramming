# ForeverAlone: Getting Shit Done  
Roadmap and Software Development Methodology for Sole Programmers and Freelancers

##Motivation
I have been struggling to find any minimal software development methodology that can work for relatively small, one-two person projects.  
When I researched the topic it was not uncommon to find testimonies like ["I held a progress meeting with myself over a one-man burn down chart every morning"](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/59713/best-development-methodology-for-one-person).  

Personally [Programming motherfucker](http://programming-motherfucker.com/) style cowboy programming often lead me to unfinished projects and frustration. Sadly I was never able to fully get the hang of the popular [agile methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), no matter how much I tried. So I went back in time to university, where the infamous, traditional [Rational Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process) had been forced down to our throats, way before we ever acquired any software development experience. Despite the bad timing on learning it, I liked it. This gave me the first insight to the big picture of what the hell is going on in a corporate ~~workpace~~ playground. Several years ago this thread of thoughts led me to [Agile Unified Process](http://www.ambysoft.com/unifiedprocess/agileUP.html) (AUP) and started to use it in my solo projects.  

> If nobody supervises you, you have to supervise yourself. (Bucket list, Item 179, status: completed - first time  I quote myself.)  
  
Time flew, things changed, books were read, experience were gained and I found myself using a reduced, lean, flexible and completely raped version of AUP.  
I also noticed there are many repetitive administrative work I was doing over and over again every time I applied this to a new project. Now, the time finally came to armor myself with a guide and a bunch of templates on this development process.  

## Disclaimer:
I am not an expert on the topic, I just outline a process that works better for me, than anything else I tried before.  

## Before you start
