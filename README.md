Software Development Methodology for sole developers

##Motivation
I have been struggling to find any minimal software development methodology that can work for relatively small one-two person projects.  
When I researched the topic it was not uncommon to find testimonies like ["I held a progress meeting with myself over a one-man burn down chart every morning"](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/59713/best-development-methodology-for-one-person).  

Personally [Programming motherfucker](http://programming-motherfucker.com/) style cowboy programming often lead me to unfinished projects and frustration.  
[Agile methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) though very popular, but I found most of it unfit to my development style.  
Back then during university, next to agile, [Rational Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process) also had been forced into our brains and I still see the (long forgotten) values in the more traditional methods.  
Years ago this thread of thoughts led me to [Agile Unified Process](http://www.ambysoft.com/unifiedprocess/agileUP.html) (AUP) and I was using a **very unique!** interpretation of it since then.  
I should mention I also incorporate a couple of pragmatic tips I acquired from the life management book, called [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) and the [lean startup](https://leanstack.com/running-lean-book/) philosophy of entrepreneurs.

I noticed there are a bunch of repetitive administrative work I am doing over and over again when I apply this to a new project of mine, so it is time to armor myself with a guide and templates on this development process and I share it on GitHub, maybe others find value in it, too. Feel free to contribute!  

### Note: 
I do not consider myself to be an expert in software development methodologies, I just outline a process that works better for me, than anything else I tried before.
