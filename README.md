Software Development Methodology for Sole Programmers and Small Teams  
Project Development Roadmap for Freelancers

##Motivation
I had been struggling to find any lean software development methodology that can work for small teams.  
Whenever I researched the topic it was not uncommon to find testimonies like ["I held a progress meeting with myself over a one-man burn down chart every morning"](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/59713/best-development-methodology-for-one-person).

Personally [Programming motherfucker](http://programming-motherfucker.com/) style cowboy programming often led me to unfinished projects and frustration, I am just not that good yet. Sadly I was never able to fully get the hang of the today popular [agile methodologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), no matter how much I tried. So I went back in time to university, where the infamous, traditional [Rational Unified Process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rational_Unified_Process) had been forced down our throats, way before we ever acquired any software development experience. Despite the bad timing on learning it, I liked it. This gave me the first insight to the big picture of what the hell is going on in the corporate ~~workpace~~ playground. Several years ago this thread of thoughts led me to [Agile Unified Process](http://www.ambysoft.com/unifiedprocess/agileUP.html) (AUP) and started to use it in my solo projects.  

> If nobody supervises you, you have to supervise yourself. (Bucket list, Item 179, status: completed - first time  I quote myself.)  
  
Time flew, things changed, books were read, experience were gained and I found myself using a reduced, lean, flexible and completely raped version of AUP.  
Now, the time finally came to armor myself with a guide on this development process.  

## Disclaimer:
I am not an expert on the topic, I just outline a practical roadmap that works better for me, than anything else I tried before.  

## Before you start

### Ask yourself: "Is FAP for me?"   
Fortunately there is a mechanic way to decide it, by answering a few questions.  
1. Does my project involve a small team?  
2. Am I mostly my own boss?  
3. What stage am I at the [Dreyfus model](https://github.com/nopara73/ForeverAloneProgramming/wiki/The-Five-Dreyfus-Model-Stages)?  
If your answer to this question is not `Advanced Beginner`, `Competent` or maybe `Proficient`, then your answer to the main question is no.  

### Read: [Beware the Tool Trap](https://github.com/nopara73/ForeverAloneProgramming/wiki/Beware-the-Tool-Trap)

|Are you sharing my obsession with books, TED talks and similar materials? If so, chances are they leave a guilty feeling in you, because you fail to apply the information in practice. The reason is because they are not instantly applicable. You have to apply them at the right time, the right place, in proper context. If you are anything like me and the most important part of your life is when you are working on something your are enthusiastic about, **consider forking this repository and improve upon it** every time you gain a new insight. And the guilty feeling will evaporate.|
